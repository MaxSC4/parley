# Installation

Let's install Parley and make sure it loads. This is a short, safe setup you can follow once and reuse forever.

## Do this first: place the folder
1) Copy the `parley` folder into `Packages/`.
2) Confirm `Package.toml` is in the package root.
3) Start the server and check that Parley loads.

### Folder structure
```
Packages/
  parley/
    Package.toml
    Shared/
    Server/
    Client/
```

## What happens in-game
When the server starts, Parley will load and be ready for use.

## What's next?
In the next section, we will run a dialogue in under five minutes.
